# <div align="center"> :satellite: Satellite Image Cloud Removal :fog:</div>


## ðŸŽ„ Problem Statement: 
### To remove cloud from multispectral image captured under poor  weather condition.

<br/>

## âœ¨ Proposed Solution: 
1. ###  Preparation of paired dataset of cloudy and respective non-cloudy multispectral images.
